# The Effect of Background Contrast on Perceived Transparency Evaluated with Contrast Metrics



minimal_example_stimuli_creation.ipynb shows an simple example of the creation of the stimuli. It shows the creation of three stimuli, contrast metrics calculation and their ratio calculation of one stimulus.


The Stimuli.ipynb shows the creation of all stimuli (120 stimuli in total), the contast metrics calculations and ratio calculations.


The table.txt visualises every value for every stimulus in a table form. It shows background luminance values, transmittance alpha, luminance tau of the transparent medium, Michelson contrasts for inside and outside values, MC ratio, Space-averaged Michelson contrasts for inside and outside values, SAM ratio, Space-averaged logarithm of Michelson contrasts for inside and outside values, SAMLG ratio, Space-averaged Whittle contrasts for inside and outside values and SAW ratio.
